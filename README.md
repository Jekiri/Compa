Your virtual Companion for boring tasks like homework or fun things like gaming! Change the way you look at the boring stuff and make the fun stuff even better!

# (‡≤†‚Äø‚Üº) <u>Why should I want a Compa?</u>
<p>
Compa was designed to make boring experience's more fun! Compa brings a way to gamify the boring experience and turn it into a fun way to stay on track.

Your Compa will reward you for having linked applications open. By default, Word is one of the  apps linked to your Compa. Don't use Word? Don't worry, your Compa has a custom app linker. <i>Please find instructions for the app linker under the 'Linking apps' and 'Unlinking apps' section.</i>

Your Compa will also reward you for playing games with them! By default, Steam is one of the apps that is linked to your Compa. Compa can see what Steam game you are playing and can even look up the Wiki for you! Compa's love to play games!

So, try a Compa today and never look at the boring stuff the same!

><br>
> These checks influence the mood of your Compa

> Your Compa increases in age by 1 every 25 minutes.

&nbsp;
<u>**Points**</u><br>
> Points are influenced by your Compa's mood, age & generation!
> Earn points by having applications that are linked to your Compa, open in order to increase your Compa's mood, to gain points over time or, Play/Feed or put your Compa to sleep for a small point increase and a temporary mood increase!
